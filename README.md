### Description

I recently had a co-worker approach me asking that I assist them with a password-protected Word 97 document for which they had forgotton the password. This program performs a brute-force attack against a password protected Microsoft Word document. The code utilizes dynamic arrays, vba office automation, common dialogs, numeric-only textboxes, and the timer control examples. In future iterations I would like to include the ability to limit the possible characters searched, multi-processor support, as well as additional types of office documents (i.e. workbooks, databases...)
 
### More Info
 
A word document, and a minimum and maximum password length restraint.

Setec Astronomy
